# ShopCheck
This program lets you input a city and suggests what food you should serve if you want to start a restaurant there.

There are two ways to run this file. The first is to simply download the executable file shopcheck.exe.
The second involves downloading shopcheck.py and running this via the command prompt. This does require installing both Python, and the Requests library.
Python can be found at https://www.python.org/.
Requests can be found at https://pypi.org/project/requests/.
Once these are installed you navigate your way to the directory where you downloaded shopcheck.py and enter _py shopcheck.py_

When you run the program, it will ask you to name a city or town. Once you have done this, it will print some helpful tips for your restaurant.

The Python file will then finish the process while keeping the text in the prompt.
The Executable will remain open until you exit the window, or input anything.
